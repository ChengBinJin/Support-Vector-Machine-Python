    "Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm capable of performing classification, regression and even outlier detection. The linear SVM (LSVM) classifier works by drawing a straight line between two classes. All the data points that fall on one side of the line will be labeled as one class and all the points that fall on the other side will be labeled as the second. Sounds simple enough, but there's an infinite amount to lines to choose from. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know which line will do the best job of classifying the data? This is where the LSVM algorithm comes in to ply. The LSVM algorithm will select a line that not only separates the two classes but stays as far away from the closest samlpes as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the \"support vector\" in \"support vector machine\" refers to two position vectors drawn from the origin to the points which judge the decision boundary."

    "Suppose, we had a vector _w_ which is always normal to the hyperplane (perpendicular to the line in 2 dimensions). We can determine how far away a sample is from our decision boundary by projecting the position vector of the sample on the vector *w*. \n",

    "As a quick refresher, the dot product of two vectors is proportional to the projection of the first vector on the second."
